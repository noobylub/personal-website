          <hr />
          My name is Muhammad Mushoffa, and I am a student at Kings Academy. I
          wish to study Computer Science and Business. I love to create things,
          which is why I am incredibly motivated to learn to code. My passion
          for legos inspired my current aspirations. Beginning with legos as a
          child. I love to build anything to my heart's content. However, I also
          love Businesses and learn more about them and ponder the question,
          "what makes a succesfull business." Currently, I am taking a
          tremendous amount of interest in Blockchain Technology. I am
          interested in its wide range of applications in our world. I believe
          Blockchain can change our world, and I wish to be at the forefront of
          that.

                Started an Investment Club, a club that teaches students
                investment strategies. We also compete in Investment
                competitions and apply our investment strategies in these
                Investment Competitions. In the end we wrote a paper detailing
                our investment strategy.

                Still in the planning process; however, I plan to implement
